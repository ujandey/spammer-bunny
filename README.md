# 🐰 Spammer Bunny

> _"Some bunnies just want to watch the world burn..."_

**Spammer Bunny** is a tiny `.exe` tool that lets you spam any text multiple times — on WhatsApp, Discord, Notepad, browser chat boxes, or literally anywhere you can type.  
Just enter a message, the number of times, and let the Bunny do the chaos 🧨
